Project developed during the Nodejs trail in 4th edition of Next Level Week, created by Rocketseat. This project is a back-end application that consists of calculating the company's NPS. In it, we register users, register surveys, **send e-mail** to users to answer satisfaction surveys and with this we can perform the NPS calculation.

The Net Promoter Score is a type of metric created to measure customer satisfaction, as: "From 0 to 10, how much you recommend our company?"

## Technologies and tools used:
